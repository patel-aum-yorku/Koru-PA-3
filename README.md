### Try the demo of the core features here - https://snazzy-cactus-41c85e.netlify.app/
ðŸš€ **Built at Koru x Ecosystem Hackathon 2025**  

## **Overview**  
This project was developed during the **Koru x Ecosystem Hackathon 2025** to tackle the challenge of **Enhancing Digital Learning**. Our AI-powered platform helps students effectively navigate online resources while minimizing over-reliance on technology. It ensures credible research, adapts to individual learning needs, and fosters critical thinking.  


## **Key Features**  
âœ… **Credible Search Results** â€“ Uses **Google Search API** and **Cohere AI** to filter reliable resources.  
âœ… **Reading Level Adaptation** â€“ Simplifies complex texts for students who need it.  
âœ… **AI Summaries (Teacher-Controlled)** â€“ Auto-generates article overviews with optional teacher permissions.  
âœ… **Reflection Prompts** â€“ Encourages critical thinking with AI-suggested or custom questions.  
âœ… **Focus Mode** â€“ Helps students stay engaged by minimizing distractions.  
âœ… **Teacher Dashboard** â€“ Tracks student progress, engagement, and Focus Mode usage.  

This repository contains the implementation of a solution for Problem Area 3. The project is primarily developed using React.JS, with some HTML and CSS.
## **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **APIs Used:** Google Search API, Cohere AI  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Teachers curate resources** by tagging articles as **Understandable and Not-Understandable**.  
2. **Students access AI-filtered search results**, ensuring only high-quality materials are available. 
3. **AI-generated summaries** help students grasp key points (if enabled by teachers).  
5. **Reflection prompts** are attached to Mandatory resources for deeper learning.  
  

## **Setup Instructions**  
### **Prerequisites**  
- Node.js & npm  
- Google Search API Key  
- Cohere AI API Key  



## Project Setup

This project uses React with Vite for the development environment. The setup includes hot module replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules for code quality.
